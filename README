Node.JS Logo Scraper
====================

Accepts one parameter, the url of the website you wish to scrape the logo of, this is presumed to be a root level url; however, subdirectories or files are also likely to yield some form of result.

Taken into account are:
  - img tags within a variety of commonly named classes and or ids
  - commonly named ids and or classes with background images
  - images with filenames the same as the title of the page
  - images with filenames the same as the website's domain
  - OpenGraph image meta tag
  - iOS icon meta tag(s)

I have only tested this on a relatively small selection of websites, and will continue to add in more common design naming conventions as I come across them. At present it works fairly well on web conference / social event websites (as per its design), I have also seen varying degrees of success on web designer portfolios.

This script makes use of the node.js module jsdom; of which there is a bug which I have report here: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues#issue/81. You can make the amendment provided on the thread yourself until they patch it to allow this code to function.
